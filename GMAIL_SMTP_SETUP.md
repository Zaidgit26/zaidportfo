# 📧 Gmail SMTP Setup Guide for Real-time Email Delivery

Your contact form is ready! Follow these steps to enable real-time email delivery to `reachme.zaid@gmail.com`.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Sign in with your Gmail account (`reachme.zaid@gmail.com`)
3. Under "Signing in to Google", click **"2-Step Verification"**
4. Follow the prompts to enable 2FA (you'll need your phone)

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. After enabling 2FA, go back to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Under "Signing in to Google", click **"2-Step Verification"**
3. Scroll down to **"App passwords"** section
4. Click **"App passwords"**
5. Select **"Mail"** from the dropdown
6. Click **"Generate"**
7. **Copy the 16-character password** (it looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
1. Open your `.env.local` file
2. Replace `your_gmail_app_password_here` with your actual app password:

```env
EMAIL_USER=reachme.zaid@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

**Important**: Remove the spaces from the app password, so it becomes: `abcdefghijklmnop`

### Step 4: Restart Your Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Test the Setup

1. Go to your contact form
2. Fill out a test message
3. Submit the form
4. Check the console logs for success messages
5. Check your email inbox for the message

## 🔍 Expected Console Output (Success)

When working correctly, you should see:
```
Attempting to send email via SMTP...
Creating SMTP transporter for: reachme.zaid@gmail.com
SMTP connection verified successfully
✅ Email sent successfully!
Message ID: <some-message-id>
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid login"
- **Cause**: Wrong app password or 2FA not enabled
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify 2FA is enabled
  2. Generate a new app password
  3. Update `.env.local` with the new password
  4. Restart the server

### Error: "SMTP credentials not configured"
- **Cause**: Environment variables not set
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check `.env.local` exists in your project root
  2. Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are set
  3. Restart the server

### Error: "Connection timeout"
- **Cause**: Network or firewall issues
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check your internet connection
  2. Try from a different network
  3. Contact your ISP if the issue persists

### No errors but no email received
- **Cause**: Email might be in spam folder
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check your spam/junk folder
  2. Add your own email to safe senders
  3. Check Gmail's "All Mail" folder
